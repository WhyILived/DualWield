# TwelveLabs Gameplay Downtime Analysis Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the results of analyzing gameplay downtime events in three popular games: **Valorant**, **League of Legends**, and **CS:GO**. The analysis was performed using a custom Python script leveraging the TwelveLabs Analyze API with a specialized prompt to detect periods of inactivity, death screens, respawn waits, and related events.

## Approach

- Developed a Python script `./analyze.py` to interface with the TwelveLabs API.
- The script uploads videos, checks for existing indexes, and runs a detailed prompt to extract downtime segments.
- The prompt was designed to generalize across different games, starting from Valorant and extending to League of Legends and CS:GO.

## Videos Used

- [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrdh5HrOCMc)
- [League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnpljMWwy3o)
- [CS:GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4QG59y6FGE)

## Prompt

```text
Analyze this video for gameplay downtime events. Specifically:

Identify and return all time segments where the player is:
- Eliminated / killed / dies
- In a "death screen", spectator mode, or report screen
- Waiting to respawn
- Viewing death summaries or kill cam

For each death/downtime event:
- Return the start and end timestamps
- Include any visible text such as: "report", "you are dead", "respawning in"
- Indicate if the screen has a grayscale effect, red tint, or other visual indicator

Identify loading screens, including:
- Matchmaking wait screens
- Round transitions or pre-game loadouts
- Black screens with logos or rotating animations

Identify and return:
- Periods of visual inactivity (no player motion, HUD only, waiting states)
- UI overlays that indicate player is not active (e.g., menus, scoreboards)

For each segment, return:
- The timestamp
- The reason (e.g., "death", "loading", "idle", "respawn wait")
- Any visible keywords or UI elements
- If possible, extract a thumbnail image or text snapshot from that frame
```

## Results

### Valorant

- **Death / Combat Report:** Multiple segments detected with timestamps, visible "combat report" text, and red tint indicators.

- **Idle / Buy Phase:** Several periods identified where the player is in the buy menu, selecting weapons and abilities.
- **Idle / Countdown Timer:** Player stands still during countdowns.
- **Summary:** The model accurately captured deaths, idle phases, and transitions, with detailed timestamps and UI elements.

## Conclusion

- The TwelveLabs API, combined with a tailored prompt, effectively identifies gameplay downtime events across different games.
- The approach generalizes well, with accurate detection of deaths, idle phases, and loading screens.
- Even in videos with few deaths (e.g., CS:GO), the model extracts useful periods of inactivity and UI overlays.
- These results can be further utilized for gameplay analytics, highlight generation, or player behavior studies.
