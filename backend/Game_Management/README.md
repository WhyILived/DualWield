## Valorant Combat Report Detector (OCR-based Death Detection)
This script uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect when the "Combat Report" appears on screen in Valorant, signaling that the player has died. It logs both:

✅ When the combat report appears (you died)

❎ When it disappears (you respawn or round ends)

# 📦 Features
🔍 Real-time OCR using Tesseract

🎯 Scans only a small screen region for performance

🕒 Logs precise timestamps of death and respawn

🔁 Loop runs until user exits

💻 No interference with game process — safe and ban-free
