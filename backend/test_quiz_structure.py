    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms 
    and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a 
    specific task through experience. It involves training models on data to make 
    predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.
    
    There are three main types of machine learning:
    1. Supervised Learning - where the model learns from labeled training data
    2. Unsupervised Learning - where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data
    3. Reinforcement Learning - where the model learns through trial and error
    
    Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, 
    recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
